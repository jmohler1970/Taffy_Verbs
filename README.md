# Taffy_video2
Using Taffy part 3

I talked so much during my first Taffy example, I had to split it into two videos.

This is the second set of code, but it is the third video. Sorry for the confusion

The main goal of this Repository is to build upon the previous. I want a much more flexible kind of resource.
